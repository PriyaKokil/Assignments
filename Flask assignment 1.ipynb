    "Flask is a web framework, it’s a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily. \n",
    "It’s has a small and easy-to-extend core: it’s a microframework that doesn’t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) or such features.\n",
    "A Web Application Framework or a simply a Web Framework represents a collection of libraries and modules that enable web application developers to write applications without worrying about low-level details such as protocol, thread management, and so on.\n",
    "It does have many cool features like url routing, template engine. It is a WSGI web app framework.\n",
    "Flask is a web application framework written in Python. It was developed by Armin Ronacher, who led a team of international Python enthusiasts called Poocco. \n",
    "Flask is based on the Werkzeg WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine.Both are Pocco projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Flask Framework\n",
    "1. Scalable\n",
    "Size is everything, and Flask’s status as a microframework means that you can use it to grow a tech project such as a web app incredibly quickly. \n",
    "2. Flexible\n",
    "This is the core feature of Flask, and one of its biggest advantages.\n",
    "To paraphrase one of the principles of the Zen of Python, simplicity is better than complexity, because it can be easily rearranged and moved around.\n",
    "3. Easy to negotiate\n",
    "Like Django, being able to find your way around easily is key for allowing web developers to concentrate on just coding quickly, without getting bogged down\n",
    "4. Lightweight\n",
    "When we use this term in relation to a tool or framework, we’re talking about the design of it—there are few constituent parts that need to be assembled and reassembled, and it doesn’t rely on a large number of extensions to function. \n",
    "5. Documentation\n",
    "Following the creator’s own theory that “nice documentation design makes you actually write documentation,” Flask users will find a healthy number of examples and tips arranged in a structured manner."
