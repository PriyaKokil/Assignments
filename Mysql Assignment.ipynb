    "##  DDL : \n",
    "A data definition language (DDL) is a computer language used to create and modify the structure of database objects in a database. \n",
    "These database objects include views, schemas, tables, indexes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create\n",
    "This command builds a new table and has a predefined syntax. The CREATE statement syntax is:\n",
    "CREATE TABLE [table name] ([column definitions]) [table parameters];\n",

    "CREATE TABLE Employee (Employee Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, First name CHAR (50) NULL, Last name CHAR (75) NOT NULL);\n",

    "2. Alter\n",
    "An alter command modifies an existing database table. This command can add up additional column, drop existing columns and even change the data type of columns involved in a database table.\n",
    "An alter command syntax is:\n",
    "ALTER object type object name parameters;\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employee ADD PRIMARY KEY (employee_pk);\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Drop\n",
    "A drop command is used to delete objects such as a table, index or view. A DROP statement cannot be rolled back, so once an object is destroyed, thereâ€™s no way to recover it.\n",
    "Drop statement syntax is:\n",
    "DROP object type object name;\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "DROP TABLE Employee;\n",
    "\n",

    "Similar to DROP, the TRUNCATE statement is used to quickly remove all records from a table. However, unlike DROP that completely destroys a table, TRUNCATE preserves its full structure to be reused later.\n",
    "Truncate statement syntax is:\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Employee;"

    "3. A foreign key always matches the primary key column in another table. \n",
